Some simple examples of using popular charting libraries with [xAPIWrapper](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPIWrapper).

This project is a little demonstration and not intended to be an application. 

If you are looking for a reporting tool for [Experience API](http://www.adlnet.gov/tla/experience-api/) statements then I recommend to check out ADL's [xAPI-Dashboard](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Dashboard) xAPI reporting suite instead.
