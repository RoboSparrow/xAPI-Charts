Simple example of using different charting  libraries with [xAPIWrapper](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPIWrapper)

This project is just a little excercise, not an application. 

If you are looking for a reporting tool for [Experience API](http://www.adlnet.gov/tla/experience-api/) statements then I recommend to check out ADL's [xAPI-Dashboard](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Dashboard) xAPI reporting suite instead.
