Simple example of using the [epoch charting library](http://fastly.github.io/epoch/) with [xAPIWrapper](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPIWrapper)

This project is just thought as a little excercise. 

If you are looking for a reporting tool for [Experience API](http://www.adlnet.gov/tla/experience-api/) statements then I recomment to check out ADL's [xAPI-Dashboard](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Dashboard) xAPI reporting suite instead.
